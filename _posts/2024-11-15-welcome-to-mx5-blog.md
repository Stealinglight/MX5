The Talaria MX5, also known as 黑快 (Black Fast), is an incredible electric dirt bike that serves as both a commuter and an off-road machine. This blog will chronicle my journey as I customize and upgrade various aspects of the bike to better suit my needs.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find:

- **Detailed modification guides** - Step-by-step instructions with photos
- **Product reviews** - Honest reviews of parts and accessories I've installed
- **Performance updates** - Real-world testing and feedback on modifications
- **Lessons learned** - Both successes and failures along the way

## Current Modifications

So far, I've completed the following modification:

### Rear Rack Installation

I've upgraded the rear cargo area with a KEMIMOTO rack that can carry up to 12lbs. This has been a game-changer for my daily commutes, allowing me to securely transport my heavy-duty motorcycle lock and chain.
