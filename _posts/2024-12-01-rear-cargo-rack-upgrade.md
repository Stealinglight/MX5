## KEMIMOTO Rear Rack Compatible with Talaria Sting Luggage Rack

I've been commuting downtown on my Talaria MX5 and needed a solution for carrying my motorcycle lock and chain. After searching for a rear rack that fit well and could handle the daily load, I came across the KEMIMOTO Rear Rack for Talaria Sting bikes. This rack is compatible with the MX3, MX4, and MX5, and it's exactly what I needed.

### Product Links

- [Buy on AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806050818933.html)

### Product Features

The rack has a weight capacity of up to 12lbs and comes in a sleek black, powder-coated finish. The metal construction is solid, and the powder coating should protect it from rust and wear, especially during the rainy season. The small lip around the edges of the rack helps keep my chain from sliding around when it's wrapped around the back, providing a stable place for the lock while riding.

## Installation Process

### Before the Installation

Here's a shot of how I used to wrap the chain around the rear seat for storage:

It wasn't ideal, as the chain would shift around, but it was manageable before I found a better solution.

### Pre-Installation of the Rear Rack

This is the stock fender before I removed it. There are 3 screws and 2 bolts to take out during the process:

### Post-Installation of the Rear Rack

Once the stock fender was removed, I installed the rear rack using all the original hardware. The two bolts are the main connection points since there is a gap between the rack and the seat that the screws didn't fully penetrate:

### Final Installation

Here are two images of the final install. It's a solid fit, and the rack holds securely:

## Performance and Commuting Experience

It's been 3 weeks since I installed the rack, and I've had zero issues carrying the weight of my lock and chain. I use the **Kryptonite New York 1213 Cinch Ring** lock, which is about 5kg (just under the rack's weight limit of 12lbs).
